The following steps will install BrainBase:

1) Install Perl Catalyst
I'm really sorry about this. Perl Catalyst is fantastic and amazing when it's working. But installation can sometimes be a route to no happiness.
The most certain way to have a bad time installing Perl Catalyst is to try to install it on an old Linux system. By "old" I mean anything that is not running the most up-to-date kernel.
I have the best experience installing Perl Catalyst right on top of a fresh Linux install. 
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalyst::Runtime'
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalyst::Devel'
2) You will need the following Catalyst Plugins from CPAN:
        Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication
        Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::SimpleDB
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::File
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie
        Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema
        Catalyst::Controller::FormBuilder
        MooseX::MarkAsMethods
        MooseX::NonMoose
        DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader
        DBIx::Class::TimeStamp
        DBIx::Class::PassphraseColumn
        HTML::FormHandler::Model::DBIC
3) Put the Brainbase folder in your home directory
4) You are going to be using MySQL. Most Linux distributions come with the MySQL database server and the client utility. If not, you can get it here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
5) Configure MySQL for your Linux system. For Slackware 14 I follow the directions here: http://www.neiland.net/blog/article/configuring-mysql-on-slackware/
If you follow the directions closely you should have no problem.
6) Once MySQL is configured log in as root:
$ mysql -u root -p
..
mysql>
Check that InnoDB is supported.
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_innodb';
If mysql returns the value as YES it is supported.
7) Create a database called brainbase
mysql> CREATE DATABASE brainbase;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON brainbase.* TO [username] IDENTIFIED BY '[PASSWORD]';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit
Bye
8) Load your brainbase_users.sql into MySQL:
$ mysql -u [username] -p brainbase < brainbase_users.sql
This will give you tables named users, roles, and user_roles.
9) Generate your Catalyst model:
$ script/brainbase_create.pl model DB DBIC::Schema Brainbase:Schema create=static \
     components=TimeStamp,PassphraseColumn dbi:mysql:brainbase '[username]' '[password]' '{ AutoCommit => 1 }'
10) Open terminal and go to the ~/Brainbase folder
11) Start the server!
$ script/brainbase_server.pl -rp 3000 # or whatever port you might wish to run it on.
